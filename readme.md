# Logseq Plugin Link Preview

A simple plugin to show basic link information (based on [OpenGraph Protocol](https://ogp.me/)) for external links in Logseq.

By default when it is enabled, when you hovering any external link in Logseq, it will show the link preview.
Also this plugin will register a `Convert to Link Card` command for you to convert the link to a link card.

## Disclaimer ðŸš¨

- This plugin WILL send network requests to the author's server https://logseq-plugin-link-preview.vercel.app/. If you feel insecure about it, please either do not use it, or deploy it yourself, which is explained in the next session.
- The link preview does not always work. e.g., internal links inside of your private network.

## Features

- Show link preview when hovering any external link in Logseq
- Convert the link to a link card when you use the `Convert to Link Card` command
- Cache the results locally
- Light & dark theme

### Deploy your own backend

Due to some technical limitations (CORS), the link preview metadata could not work without a proxy server.
The easiest solution is to deploy your own backend to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) using serverless functions:

- fork this plugin repository
- import your forked repository as a new project in Vercel
- configure it with `FRAMEWORK PRESET` to Other
- override `INSTALL COMMAND` in Build settings to `npm i pnpm -g && pnpm i`
- click deploy. After deploy is done, you can now replace the `https://logseq-plugin-link-preview.vercel.app/` with your own backend URL.

## How does this plugin work?

### Hovering Mode

It will register `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` events on all external links in the main document of Logseq. Note, in this step this plugin uses a unsafe `top` context of the main document, which might not work in the future.

In the listener, the plugin will extract the `href` attribute of the link and send a request to an API server to get the link information (the OpenGraph metadata).

Once the api returns with the link metadata (e.g., title, description, image), the plugin will

- render them in the plugin iframe
- resize the iframe and move its position to the hovering link

### Inline Mode

Typically, user will use slash command to create a embedded `iframe` to replace the URL in the block:

```html
<iframe
  data-url="https://twitter.com/pengx17/status/1428025254144880645"
  src="file:///Users/username/Documents/GitHub/logseq-plugin-link-preview/dist/index.html"
></iframe>
```

The entry `src` is exactly the same resource that is being used for hovering mode, where the `data-url` will be used for fetching the link metadata.

Similar to Hovering Mode, we need to fetch the link metadata first.
Once the api returns with the link metadata (e.g., title, description, image), the plugin will

- render them in the plugin iframe
- resize the iframe (do not need to move its position this time)
